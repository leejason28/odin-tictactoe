class Game 
    initialization will create a new game board and new players 'X' and 'O'
    since this represents an instance of a game, the class should have all the logic for how the game is played:
        #game_over? will check after every player move if the game is over
        #update_board will update the board to reflect the passed-in move

class Board
    initialization will create an empty nested 3x3 array

class Player
    initialization will create a 'player' that is either 'X' or 'O'

class move
    initialization will requre a (player, row, column)
